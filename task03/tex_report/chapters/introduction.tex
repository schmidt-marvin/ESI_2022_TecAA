\section{Introduction}
In E-Commerce applications, customer reviews provide valuable information to both the seller and potential other customers. A review, in our case consisting of a title, a general text section and a rating from one to five stars, may for example be used to measure the quality of a product or the general reception of the product being sold. Star ratings given by customers represent this very metric, the overall opinion about the bought item.\\

Within this exercise, we aim to solve the classification problem of predicting the star rating of multiple reviews from the title and general text section only. To do this, we'll be utilizing Natural Language Processing techniques as taught within the laboratory section. The dataset used for both the training and testing process originates from \texttt{products.csv}, containing 50808 reviews entries of drinkable and edible products. Besides the already mentioned features, the various other features such as \texttt{ProductID} need to be discarded. \\

The suggested workflow defined within the task definition follows the schematic presented during the laboratory session. First, the dataset needs to be preprocessed and prepared for usage. Following this step, a vectorization and feature selection step are required. Finally, the main part is to train a classifier, including parameter tuning. This report presents notable considerations of each step, providing code snippets wherever applicable.
