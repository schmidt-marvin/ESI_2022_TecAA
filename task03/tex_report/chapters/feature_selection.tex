\section{Feature Selection}
For feature reduction, we used \texttt{SelectKBest} with a \textit{chi-square} score function to reduce the number of features by 70\% and remove the less important ones. After this, we can include all this information in a dataframe to be exported and used in the following phase. One thing has to be taken into account: when using the number of adjectives, words or sentences, this column needs to be normalized in order to have better models.\\

This feature reduction was applied to each configuration, leaving us with a dataframe at the end. The following example corresponds to the configuration \texttt{TFIDF + N-grams + POS tagging + Other features} (see Figure \ref{Figure_FeatureSelection_01}).
